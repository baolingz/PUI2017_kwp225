HW #7

For the Citibike mini project, I worked in a group with Matt, Valeria, and Tarek. We went through each of the reviews/comments we received from our classmates and discussed which statistical tests would be most appropriate for our hypothesis. We continued the analysis/code that we started in HW#3, and used the t-test to reject our null hypothesis. We used Authorea to collaboratively write up our analysis and discussion. 

Our Authorea writeup is uploaded as a pdf and also publicly available at the link here: https://www.authorea.com/users/175471/articles/210788-average-age-of-citi-bike-users-based-on-gender.
