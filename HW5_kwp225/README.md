Part 1:
I worked on this part individually. This was an extension of the work we did in class to show that  Z-scores are normally distributed.

Part 2:
I worked on this part individually, basing most of my work on the sample code provided in the skeleton notebook. This was to test the difference between binomial/Poisson distributions and the Gaussian distribution using various statistical tests. 

Part 3:
I started this part individually, but then discussed questions with and worked with several people on the rest, mainly Sam and Valeria. This involved a lot of data cleaning and plotting to interpret the relationships among several different datasets.
