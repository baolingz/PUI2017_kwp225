Part 1:
I worked on this part individually, using the provided skeleton notebook. The example code was modified to include 5 different distributions via loops and dictionaries. The means of the samples for each distributions demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem.

Part 2:
I worked with Valeria and Matt on this section. We formulated the hypothesis, downloaded and cleaned the data from the CUSP Data Facility, and plotted the data.

Part 3:
I worked on this part individually. The majority of the work was already done during class, so this was section was just formally stating the hypothesis and cleaning the code and results.
